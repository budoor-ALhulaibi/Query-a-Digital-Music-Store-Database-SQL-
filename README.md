# Query-a-Digital-Music-Store-Database-SQL-
In this project, you will query the Chinook Database. The Chinook Database holds information about a music store. For this project, you will be assisting the Chinook team with understanding the media in their store, their customers and employees, and their invoice information. 

Instructions
Step 1: Get the Chinook database up and running.
You can run the DB Browser database on your own machine (See the Set Up the DB Browser Database page) or you can use the provided workspace (see the Chinook Postgres SQL Workspace page).

Step 2: Complete the SQL Question Sets
This series of questions will confirm that you have mastered the main concepts taught throughout the SQL lessons. These questions will not be "graded" by a reviewer and are intended to help you self-assess.

Step 3: Create the Presentation
There isn't a 'right answer' for this portion of the project. The project is designed to allow you to be creative in the questions you ask and then write a SQL query to pull the data needed to answer your question successfully.

You will use the pulled data to build a visual (bar chart, histogram, or another plot) that answers your question and present that information in a slide deck using PowerPoint, Google Slides or your favorite presentation software. See more information about what is required and how to submit the project on the Project Submission Details page.
